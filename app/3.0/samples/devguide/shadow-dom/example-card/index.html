    <!-- StackBlitz requires a file called index.js to be present in all JavaScript
        projects. StackBlitz automatically runs index.js. In this sample, custom elements are imported from index.js.
      
        If you're not using StackBlitz, import the custom element by uncommenting 
        the following script tag: -->

    <!--  <script type="module" src="./example-card.js"></script> -->

  </head>
  <body>
    <example-card>

        <!-- This div has no `slot` attribute. It is assigned to the default slot -->
        <div>
          Some text for the body of the card.
        </div>

        <!-- The final span has a slot name that doesn't appear in the 
             shadow tree. It doesn't get assigned, & doesn't render -->
